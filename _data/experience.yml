    I was part of the development of an autonomous monitoring system using Bluetooth sensors.
    The embedded system gathers data from various types of sensors that were placed in strategic locations.
    This data was then:
      - Sent via Bluetooth on a Raspberry PI like computer.
      - Published on a MQTT broker.
      - Displayed and monitored on a dashboard writen in HTML5 and Javascript.
